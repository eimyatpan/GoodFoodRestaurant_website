<div class="h1"><b>Our Story</b></div>
<p>
One of America's most beloved restaurants, Good Food Restaurant has welcomed guests to enjoy its contemporary American cuisine, warm hospitality, and unparalleled service in New York City for over two decades. 
Chef Michael Anthony's ever-evolving seasonal menu showcases the restaurant's relationships with local farms and purveyors.
</p> 
<p>Opened in 1994 by restaurateur Danny Meyer in a historic landmark building just north of Union Square, 
the restaurant has earned nine James Beard Awards, including "Outstanding Restaurant" and "Outstanding Chef in America".
</p>
<p>
    The menu features familiar Italian-American comfort food from Houston's kitchen – just like no two nonna's cuisine is exactly alike, Rosalie puts its own irreverent, approachably upscale, 
    regional spin on the classics: red-sauce dishes and Italian starters like house-made focaccia, Italian chopped salad and local vegetable fritto miso alongside fresh pasta made daily, 
    made to order pizza stretched, sauced and fired in the oven, and larger shared plates like bistecca Fiorentina and whole chicken Milanese. The menu blends local 
    Houston ingredients with Chris' family traditions to create unique plates like blue crab manicotti, eggplant parmesan with Rosalie's Sunday gravy, gulf shrimp fra diavolo and Texas wild boar ragu.
